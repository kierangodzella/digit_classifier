toy project to output digits in a handwritten image input

While studying computer vision and deep learning, I figured I should do 
something in my own time to use some of my skills. The purpose of this is 
to explore ground-up image recognition, in the extremely simple example of 
recognizing handwritten digits on a piece of paper. I was inspired by the 
incredible real-time processing developed by Google Translate for their image 
translation technology. Right now, I'm working through this problem in this 
notebook alone, but as I progress, I'll be scripting it into a bare-bones 
application.
